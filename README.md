# usu

usu is a very simple programming language that is currently work in progress. Usu is latin for practice. As the name implies, the language is meant to be just for practicing compiler concepts and nothing too serious. Contributions and criticisms are welcomed.

## Sample Program

You can see some sample programs in the example folder.

```
int main(int a, int b)
{
	# Assign 10 to variable a #
	int x := 10
	# print variable x #
	print(x)
}
```

## How to Build

Simply clone the repository, and use the `make` command to build the compiler. The executable file for the compiler will be placed in the bin directory. Note that the compiler is not yet fully finished.
